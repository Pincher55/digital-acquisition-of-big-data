# Course Description 

The Internet provides a wealth of data. To access those data, we must learn to navigate the abstractions that separate us from the data. These layers of abstraction ensure resilient and rapidly responsive databases. These layers are also made to preserve the database, not facilitate analysis. Over two days we will explore how to get data from the Internet to your computer. Through case studies we will demonstrate how to access application programming interfaces (APIs), discuss common data formats, and showcase common algorithms and open-source software commonly used in acquiring digital data. Participants should bring data sources related to their own research (along with their computers). In the latter portion of the second day we will sketch how to access those sources.

# Course Objective 

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:

1. Distinguish the qualitative and quantitative research paradigms
1. Understand the principles underlying qualitative research tasks
1. Design and conduct rigorous qualitative research
1. Develop and evaluate effective qualitative research instruments
1. Understand the skills for effective qualitative data collection
