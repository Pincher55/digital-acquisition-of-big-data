The http.cookiejar module defines classes for automatic handling of HTTP cookies. 
It is useful for accessing web sites that require small pieces of data – cookies – 
to be set on the client machine by an HTTP response from a web server, and then returned 
to the server in later HTTP requests.

# BeautifulSoup is a parser
soup = BeautifulSoup(page,"lxml") # easiest way to go through and pick out tags

# syntax example of easy things to miss

eg = "bob"
eg.upper() # parentheses means the application of the function
eg.upper # no parentheses means the function itself

# you would think you can do this, but this results in an error:
lst = "smith"
'{:s} {:s}'.format(eg.upper, lst.upper)

# this is because there are no parentheses to indicate the application of the function
lst = "smith"
'{:s} {:s}'.format(eg.upper(), lst.upper())

# the function isn't really a string, but str() converts it into a string and passes it on

str(lst.upper)
'{:s} {:s}'.format(str(eg.upper), str(lst.upper))
